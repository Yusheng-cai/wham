Code where I developed during my phD studies at Amish Patel's lab from 2019-2024. This code contains implementation of binned wham from the paper "
J Comput Chem. 2012 Feb 5;33(4):453-65. doi: 10.1002/jcc.21989. Epub 2011 Nov 23." and binless wham from the paper "J. Chem. Phys. 136, 144102 (2012); 
https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3701175.".
